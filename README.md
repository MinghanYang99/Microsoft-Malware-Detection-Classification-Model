# Microsoft-Malware-Detection-Classification-Model

The goal is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. 
The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, 
Windows Defender.

Conclusion:

Based on the metrics, the Decision Tree and ANN models appear to be the most promising for this application. 
The choice between them depends on the specific operational context. If ensuring malware doesn't go undetected is crucial, ANN's higher recall might be preferred. However, 
if computational resources and model interpretability are a concern, the Decision Tree could be the choice.
